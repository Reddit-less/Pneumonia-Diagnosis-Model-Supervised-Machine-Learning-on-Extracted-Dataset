# Pneumonia-Diagnosis-Model-Supervised-Machine-Learning-on-Extracted-Dataset
This project implements a supervised machine learning workflow to solve a binary classification problem: detecting pneumonia from a tabular dataset of extracted X-ray features. The model's objective is to learn the complex patterns correlating these input features to the final diagnosis.

How to run:

1 - Open the Notebook

2 - Launch the notebook in Google Colab. Datasets should already be stored in:

``"/content/drive/MyDrive/AI/1CWK100"``
